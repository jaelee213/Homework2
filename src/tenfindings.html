  <h1>Ten Findings</h1>
  <ol reversed>
    <li>MathML 
      <ul>
        <li>We were curious, of the true intent, as to what the purpose of MathML, since all MathML does is display math equations.</li>
        <li>We did acknowledge that MathML allows you to write more complex math terms (such as the square root of a number) but overall, we thought that the "p" tag would have done just the same as writing a math equation out in MathML.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>


    <li>Object tag
      <ul>
        <li>We thought it was cool how a video tag and embed tag can be written in the form of an object tag.</li>
        <li>After doing a little research, we found that the object tag is mainly for Internet Explorer and the embed tag is for Netscape <a href="http://www.stoimen.com/blog/2009/02/22/html-object-and-embed-tags/" target="_blank">[source]</a></li>
        <li>Still very interesting, nonetheless, that some tags are interchangeable (but of course, with different syntax and parameters for each tag).</li>
      </ul>
