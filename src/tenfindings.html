  <h1><strong>Ten Findings</strong></h1>
  <ol reversed>
    <li><strong>MathML</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>We were curious, of the true intent, as to what the purpose of MathML, since all MathML does is display math equations.</li>
        <li>We did acknowledge that MathML allows you to write more complex math terms (such as the square root of a number) but overall, we thought that the "p" tag would have done just the same as writing a math equation out in MathML.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <hr>

    <li><strong>object tag</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>We thought it was cool how a video tag and embed tag can be written in the form of an object tag.</li>
        <li>After doing a little research, we found that the object tag is mainly for Internet Explorer and the embed tag is for Netscape <a href="http://www.stoimen.com/blog/2009/02/22/html-object-and-embed-tags/" target="_blank">[source]</a></li>
        <li>Still very interesting, nonetheless, that some tags are interchangeable (but of course, with different syntax and parameters for each tag).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <hr>

    <li><strong>section tag</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>We were never aware of a "section" tag and because it didn't visually show any changes, we were confused of its intent at first.</li>
        <li>However, we realized that it was part of an organizational tool for people to not only write clearer code, but for people to be able to understand sections of code more clearly.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <hr>
    
    <li><strong>link and "a" tag</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>This was one of the more confusing (and took some time to understand) tags because of their similarity in linking resources to the web page.</li>
        <li>We did some more research and it was interesting to find that "a" tag was an anchor tag designed for links (external and interal), whereas the "link" tag was to link another document/resource in <em>relation</em> to the current one. <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/community/what-is-difference-between-a-hrefhtml-and-link-hrefhtml" target="_blank">[source]</a></li>
        <li>Side note: We never knew that the "a" tag allowed for in-page navigation, which was pretty cool to learn.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <hr>    

    <li><strong>bdi Tag</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The bdi tag is not supported by all browsers.</li>
        <li>After some research, it seems that this is so because the bdi tag does not inherit from the parent element like all the other elements.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <hr>
    
    <li><strong>onMouseWheelFunction()</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Our group had a long fight with trying to validate the onMouseWheelFunction() but after many efforts, we couldn't and the conclusion was that it was because the function is now deprecated.</li>
        <li>The errors stated that the attribute of the function is not allowed on element p, so we tried div and that didn't work, and we tried span and that also didn't work.</li>
        <li>In conclusion, we agreed that onMouseWheelFunction() will produce a validation error because it is deprecated.</li>
      </ul>
