  <h1><strong>Ten Findings</strong></h1>
  <ol reversed>
    <li><strong>MathML</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>We were curious, of the true intent, as to what the purpose of MathML, since all MathML does is display math equations.</li>
        <li>We did acknowledge that MathML allows you to write more complex math terms (such as the square root of a number) but overall, we thought that the "p" tag would have done just the same as writing a math equation out in MathML.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>object tag</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>We thought it was cool how a video tag and embed tag can be written in the form of an object tag.</li>
        <li>After doing a little research, we found that the object tag is mainly for Internet Explorer and the embed tag is for Netscape <a href="http://www.stoimen.com/blog/2009/02/22/html-object-and-embed-tags/" target="_blank">[source]</a></li>
        <li>Still very interesting, nonetheless, that some tags are interchangeable (but of course, with different syntax and parameters for each tag).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>section tag</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>We were never aware of a "section" tag and because it didn't visually show any changes, we were confused of its intent at first.</li>
        <li>However, we realized that it was part of an organizational tool for people to not only write clearer code, but for people to be able to understand sections of code more clearly.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>link and "a" tag</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>This was one of the more confusing (and took some time to understand) tags because of their similarity in linking resources to the web page.</li>
        <li>We did some more research and it was interesting to find that "a" tag was an anchor tag designed for links (external and interal), whereas the "link" tag was to link another document/resource in <em>relation</em> to the current one. <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/community/what-is-difference-between-a-hrefhtml-and-link-hrefhtml" target="_blank">[source]</a></li>
        <li>Side note: We never knew that the "a" tag allowed for in-page navigation, which was pretty cool to learn.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>bdi Tag</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The bdi tag is not supported by all browsers.</li>
        <li>After some research, it seems that this is so because the bdi tag does not inherit from the parent element like all the other elements.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>onMouseWheelFunction()</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Our group had a long fight with trying to validate the onMouseWheelFunction() but after many efforts, we couldn't and the conclusion was that it was because the function is now deprecated.</li>
        <li>The errors stated that the attribute of the function is not allowed on element p, so we tried div and that didn't work, and we tried span and that also didn't work.</li>
        <li>In conclusion, we agreed that onMouseWheelFunction() will produce a validation error because it is deprecated.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>keygen tag</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Upon using this tag, our group did a little research and we found that:
          <ol>
            <li>keygen tag is a tag used in forms that generates encryption key for passing encrypted data to a server.</li>
            <li>It was used for user authentication but is becoming deprecated due to lack of support from browsers.</li>
            <li>It was announced that it will be removed from HTML standards.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>dir attribute</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Setting the "dir" attribute to "rtl" (right-to-left) seemingly makes it so that strings of letters are written normally (and placed on the right), but non-letter characters (along with the cursor) are placed on the left. </li>
        <li>As we were working with this attribute, we found that the behavior was a bit strange, yet interesting.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>accesskey attribute</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>According to the documentation, the "accesskey" attribute simply states that we bind a key to something like a link in which the link would be opened if the user presses the specified key.</li>
        <li>However, Chrome/IE/Opera require shift to be pressed along with the specified key and FireFox requires alt and shift to be pressed too.</li>
        <li>It is interesting to think about why this is the case that different browsers need different actions for the same attribute which would be used the same way in a web page.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>hidden attribute</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>One could have an expectation that the "hidden" attribute would replace text or even a block with whitespace that could be accessed in a discrete way on a web page.</li>
        <li>However, when we tested the hidden attribute it seemed to not even have the element on the page at all ("hidden" in the code, but not on the page).</li>
        <li>We came to this conclusion by using hidden with a p element and what we found was that no space was set aside for the hidden element at all.</li>
        <li>This attribute might have a more advanced usage that our group did not happen across.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
